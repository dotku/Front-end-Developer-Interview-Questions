This repository is not to make the answers complete with people. This is to fill
my personal answers to the original questions. Therefore, I am afraid I do not
merge others' answers, and any PR concerning it will be silently closed.

The questions and some of its contents are from the original repository. If
interested in getting involved, it would be the right place.
